        <p><h3>Using a WordPress blog</h3></p>
            <p>
              My first encounter with HTML code and websites was in a class at Oregon State University on cultural studies, in 2007. The course was through the English Department and taught by <a href="http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/users/lisa-ede" target="_blank">Lisa Ede</a>, who is Professor Emeritus and whose work has focused on media and new literacies. For our final project she required us to submit our work to a WordPress blog which served as a central repository of all final papers. We didn't have to use the HTML tools but she encouraged us to use them. She also encouraged us to set up blogs of our own because it was a new medium for communication worth using if we were going to have careers as writers. At the time I thought this was strange, but now I value this as it gave me exposure to a website platform that I use today.

              Another thing worth mentioning is that when I applied to graduate school, I applied to PSU because I wanted to work with Dr. Karen Carr on her website (then named Kidipede and now called <a href="http://quatr.us/" target="_blank">quatr.us</a>). I guess my fascination with websites and with the infinite potential they present goes back quite a ways.

        <p><h3>the old gosw.org</h3></p>
          <p>In January of 2015, I started working at GRANTMAKERS <em>of Oregon and Southwest Washington</em>. At the time I had zero experience with the ExpressionEngine platform, but my colleague Robyn trained me on the basics and turned me loose. I was assigned the task of maintaining our website. Because we are a small nonprofit and had only ever had 2 employees (at that point in time), we had such limited capacity to engage with our members digitally that everything there was sort of built to fit what we thought people needed to know, and then it was lather, rinse, repeat. I quickly mastered the basics of ExpressionEngine nad started looking at ways to improve our site. First I reorganized a lot of the information, deleting pages that seemed redundant and cleaning up/archiving old content. I soon learned that while our web hosting partners were great, there were several limitations to the ExpressionEngine platform that prevented us from making a site that reflected who we were as an organization in 2015 and beyond.</p>
          <p><h3>SmarterGiving.org, HTML5UP, and the Jubitz Family Foundation</h3></p>
          <p>At some point in 2015, my boss forwarded an email to me from a coder she knew who had relocated to the MidWest and started a new passion project, SmarterGiving. His first project under the SmarterGiving brand was to streamline a template by HTML5UP to make it easy for private foundations with small or no staff and limited tech skills to create a website that was responsive, customizable, and could either integrate with grants management software systems like Foundant, or pull grants data from a .csv template. The template and instructions were sent to my boss who passed it along to me - "do you want to learn something new?"

          Of course I said "yes!" Shortly thereafter, the Executive Director of the Jubitz Family Foundation called us up and said she was looking to get a new website and wondered if we had any recommendations for designers. It was truly serendipitous. Using the template from SmarterGiving, I built the current <a href="http://www.jubitz.org/" target="_blank">jubitz.org site</a>. </p>
