        <p><h3>Using a WordPress blog</h3></p>
            <p>
              My first encounter with HTML code and websites was in a class at Oregon State University on cultural studies, in 2007. The course was through the English Department and taught by <a href="http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/users/lisa-ede" target="_blank">Lisa Ede</a>, who is Professor Emeritus and whose work has focused on media and new literacies. For our final project she required us to submit our work to a WordPress blog which served as a central repository of all final papers. We didn't have to use the HTML tools but she encouraged us to use them. She also encouraged us to set up blogs of our own because it was a new medium for communication worth using if we were going to have careers as writers. At the time I thought this was strange, but now I value this as it gave me exposure to a website platform that I use today.

              Another thing worth mentioning is that when I applied to graduate school, I applied to PSU because I wanted to work with Dr. Karen Carr on her website (then named Kidipede and now called <a href="http://quatr.us/" target="_blank">quatr.us</a>). I guess my fascination with websites and with the infinite potential they present goes back quite a ways.
            </p>
        <p><h3>the old gosw.org</h3></p>
          <p>In January of 2015, I started working at GRANTMAKERS <em>of Oregon and Southwest Washington</em>. At the time I had zero experience with the ExpressionEngine platform, but my colleague Robyn trained me on the basics and turned me loose. I was assigned the task of maintaining our website. Because we are a small nonprofit and had only ever had 2 employees (at that point in time), we had such limited capacity to engage with our members digitally that everything there was sort of built to fit what we thought people needed to know, and then it was lather, rinse, repeat. I quickly mastered the basics of ExpressionEngine nad started looking at ways to improve our site. First I reorganized a lot of the information, deleting pages that seemed redundant and cleaning up/archiving old content. I soon learned that while our web hosting partners were great, there were several limitations to the ExpressionEngine platform that prevented us from making a site that reflected who we were as an organization in 2015 and beyond.</p>
          <p><h3>SmarterGiving.org, HTML5UP, and the Jubitz Family Foundation</h3></p>
          <p>At some point in 2015, my boss forwarded an email to me from a coder she knew who had relocated to the MidWest and started a new passion project, SmarterGiving. His first project under the SmarterGiving brand was to streamline a template by HTML5UP to make it easy for private foundations with small or no staff and limited tech skills to create a website that was responsive, customizable, and could either integrate with grants management software systems like Foundant, or pull grants data from a .csv template. The template and instructions were sent to my boss who passed it along to me - "do you want to learn something new?"

          Of course I said "yes!" Shortly thereafter, the Executive Director of the Jubitz Family Foundation called us up and said she was looking to get a new website and wondered if we had any recommendations for designers. It was truly serendipitous. Using the template from SmarterGiving, I built the current <a href="http://www.jubitz.org/" target="_blank">jubitz.org site</a>. 
          </p>

          <p><h3>Reser and Bloomfield</h3><p>
            <p>I built the site for the Jubitz Family Foundation in early 2016; within the next year I was asked to build more foundation websites. Completed sites include <a href="http://thereserfamilyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Reser Family Foundation</a> and <a href="https://growphilanthropy.github.io/bloomfield/" target="_blank">Bloomfield Family Foundation</a>. Somewhere along in this process, I realized that this was something I really love doing. Chad also encouraged me to consider learning more about creating websites, since I was pretty good at figuring it out.</p>
          <p><h3>the new gosw.org</h3><p>
            <p>In 2017, my organization launched our new website, on a WordPress platform. Our designer, Miguel Elias of MEK Design, built the site and handed it off to me. He also ported several of the "mini-sites" we had hosted in Expression Engine to a simple single-scroll Wix platform. When we were ready to launch he mentioned that I was already figuring out the platforms pretty well and that it wasn't super hard to build these types of sites. He encouraged me to pursue learning web development.</p>
          <p><h3>Ladies Learning Code, Code Fellows, Code Academy, and LaunchCode</h3><p>
            <p>At this point it was pretty clear that I not only wanted to know more, but that other people whose opinions I respect were telling me that I should do it, and that I had a knack for it. I started researching different learning options and did some Code Academy work online; then I found a tutorial from Ladies Learning Code, who unfortunately only offer courses in Canada. I tried to follow the tutorial but it was incredibly long and I felt like I would benefit from a structured learning environment, with an instructor. My next step was to enroll in Code 101 at Code Fellows PDX, a one-day intro to HTML and CSS. Chad recommended finding a Women Who Code meetup, and I attended one where Kari Fass happened to be presenting about LaunchCode. I applied, got in, and am currently studying to be a web developer... or...? There seem to be more options that appeal to me than I initially expected!</p>
          <p><h3>goals: what's next</h3><p>
            <p>In the immediate future, I want to turn my Master's thesis into a website. I believe that Dr. Carr has piloted some important work of getting real, academic, historical knowledge out of the ivory tower and online. I know that MOOCs are also democratizing knowledge, but the reality is that many people don't want to sit through a lecture in person, let online online. Self-paced learning through exploration and hyperlink seem to be a more effective path. I didn't spend two years researching my thesis for it to molder away invisibly, and while <a href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/1016/">the full text IS available online</a>, I want to create something with a more user-friendly interface and incorporate images and videos, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jntvstp" target="_blank">Janet Stephens' fabulous recreations of Roman hairstyles</a>.</p>
